SacredBrowser - MongoDB Browser for results created with the Sacred framework.

OVERVIEW
--------

This tool is a database browser for MongoDB, intended to work with databases created by the
Sacred framework (https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred), which you have to setup properly before using 
SacredBrowser. Follow the Sacred instructions to write results into a database, then use this program
for browsing the results.

No installation is necessary - just run Sacredbrowser.py from the current directory and click
"Connect to database". If your database is not local, make sure you have got enough 
permissions to connect to the database. You may use the local "mongo" shell command
for troubleshooting.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
SacredBrowser requires the PyQt4 and pymongo packages. You also want to have a Sacred installation
on the server where you run your experiments, but it is not necessary to have a local installation.

USAGE 
-----

After connecting to a database, the tree view to the left shows you all available databases
and collections. With current versions of Sacred, you probably want to display a collection called
"default.runs" or "<something>.runs".

Use the top central widget to choose which database fields to display (and their order), the top right
widget allows filtering the database. Click on "Sort dialog" to sort entries, note that you
can choose several ordering criteria of differing priority. You can delete entries by
clicking "Delete" or pressing the DEL key. "Copy" copies the selection into the system clipboard, and
"Full entry" displays the details of an entry.

The color of an entry mostly indicates its status: blue indicates that the entry is marked as running, 
red/dark red stands for interrupted/failed runs. Furthermore, yellow stands for duplicates (detecting
duplicates is still kind of a hack).

Settings are saved between program runs, in the file ~/.sacredbrowserrc.
